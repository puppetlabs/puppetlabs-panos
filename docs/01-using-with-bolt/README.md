# Lab Overview

This lab will walk you through how to use the [Puppet Palo Alto firewall](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/panos) module with [bolt](https://puppet.com/products/bolt). At the end of this lab you will have used bolt to run tasks and apply a manifest at the command line. This is a basic lab, no prior knowledge of either Panos or bolt is required.
